                            Let's switch from talking about physical health, like having a cold, and now talk about mental health.<br/>
                            Symptoms can be upsetting thoughts, strong or big emotions, and feeling a need to do certain behaviors. If symptoms are really strong or go on for a long time, they can cause problems with people's daily life.<br/>
                            I'd like to tell you about the symptoms I have with my mental health condition. The name of my mental health condition is<br/>
                            <textarea onChange={event => this.handleChange(event)} id="text_box_number_1_page_8_script_2" defaultValue={this.getValue("text_box_number_1_page_8_script_2")} /><br/>
                            The symptoms I have include:<br/><br/>
                            <textarea onChange={event => this.handleChange(event)} id="text_box_number_2_page_8_script_2" defaultValue={this.getValue("text_box_number_2_page_8_script_2")} /><br/>
                            Before we move on to an activity where you get to think about your own symptoms, I'm wondering if there's anything about 'symptoms' that was confusing or that you want to talk more about? <br/>
                            Here are some cards that show mental health symptoms other young adults have. You might have some of these symptoms too. Let's sort them into two pilesâ€”symptoms you sometimes have and symptoms you don't have.<br/>
                            If you have questions about these symptoms, I can try to help you understand them better.
                        </p>
                   </div>
                   
                    <div id="instruction_box_number_2_page_8_script_2" className="ital custom_svg demo_box container_for_small_margin">
                        <p className="top_line_in_instruction_box">
                            Do the card sort together<br/>
                            If you have any of the same symptoms as your mentee, tell them that you have that same symptom.<br/>
                            Make sure to say "thank you for sharing."<br/><br/>
                            If they talk about their symptoms causing challenges, You can say things that show you understand, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-"That sounds hard"</li>
                            <li>-"That happens to me sometimes too"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div className='container_for_medium_margin'>
                        <p>
                            During our time together, we are going to be learning a lot about mental health and how to keep your symptoms from getting in the way of things you want to do! Remember, you are not alone in feeling this way - there are a lot of young adults, including me, who are going through similar things as you.<br/>
                            Now we will watch a video to learn more about symptoms.<br/>
