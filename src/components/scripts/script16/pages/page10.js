                        Even though mentoring is ending, we still need you to use the mood logs for two more weeks. You will continue to earn money for using the mood logs the next two weeks.<br/>
                        You can stop using the mood logs when Ariel meets you to finish mentoring.<br/>
                        Is there anything I can do to help you remember you mood logs?
