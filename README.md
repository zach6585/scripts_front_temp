Whole project:


1) Need to make it start up faster


Notes:

- On page 5 of the word document (page 5 as well in vscode) Madison said she wanted the text to line up with the text in the box, but the text is grammatically incorrect and also confusing. (somehow forgot to write down which script but I'll either figure it out or just leave it)

- On page 14 of script 11 there's something about cutting something. This means I'm getting rid of this correct?
