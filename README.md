Whole project:

1) Make changes as needed (Currently on script 4 page 5 (need to work on the body image thing))
    - Make sure everything that should be a textbox is one (Links, thing you wrote last week, etc.)
    - There are parts where she wants links to other pages (using redux)
    - Make most text boxes higher as scrolling will make things hard.
    - Solutions website
    - Make sure all checks and xs are changed to their smaller counter parts
    - Make sure text next to checks and xs is correct
    - Make sure all images are correct
    - Make sure all textboxes save properly (Don't have weird extra props)

2) Finish body image page
    - Seen on:
        - Script 3 page 7

3) Finish the comment thing (Currently on script 3 page 8)
    

Extras: 
     
    - Finish up the "last user" stuff
        - Would need to add methods to the user class in Ruby so that it would take post requests specifically to update the user's info




Questions for Ariel:

- Pages 
 
Notes:



- Save body image when done as pdf (make that its own button as an option). If emailing is simple then do that but otherwise do like print to pdf with timestamp
