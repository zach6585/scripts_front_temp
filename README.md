Whole project:

Really we can break down this into three steps:

1) Finish script 12 

2) Make changes as needed
    - buttonDiv as an id in component lists can just be removed to be a plain div
    - Make sure everything that should be a textbox is one (Links, thing you wrote last week, etc.)
    - There are parts where she wants links to other pages (using redux)
    - Make most text boxes higher as scrolling will make things hard.
    - I've been really stupid and have only been looking at an iPad Pro!! I need to make sure it works for regular iPad too. Honestly I really should just be making multiple versions depending on size (Like I did with Freshlayers).
    - Solutions website
    - Body image page
    

Extras: 
    
    - Save a value in db that's associated with the last page that user was on so that when they reload it goes back to that page, especially so they don't have to keep going back to page 1 now that this is a single page app.
        - The way to do this would have a "saved page" quality in the users table
    - Would have a "return to beginning" option on the last page
    - Need to get rid of 'here' print statements lol
    - Need to make sure that all binding prys are gone
    - If you really have extra time (obviously this isn't mandatory it'll just make things look cleaner) you can make all components ones that use hooks instead of class components
    - Make the buttons looks all cool
    - Maybe look into image caching




Questions for Ariel:

- Do you want it to look good on phones too?
