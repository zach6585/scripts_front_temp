Whole project:

1) Make changes as needed (Currently on script 6 page 1)
    - Make sure everything that should be a textbox is one (Links, thing you wrote last week, etc.)
    - There are parts where she wants links to other pages (using redux)
    - Make most text boxes higher as scrolling will make things hard.
    - Solutions website
    - Make sure all checks and xs are changed to their smaller counter parts
    - Make sure text next to checks and xs is correct
    - Make sure all images are correct
    - Make sure all textboxes save properly (Don't have weird extra props)
    - Comment thing
        - For all ones where we have sub-classes that we call, we need to make them separate files as we need to connect them to redux...
            - This is because if you, for example, click the comment thing after you render the class, it doesn't get the updated props.

2) Finish body image page
    - Seen on:
        - Script 3 page 7
        - Script 4 page 9
        - Script 5 page 7
        - Script 6 pages 6 & 8 


    

Extras: 
     
    - Finish up the "last user" stuff
        - So we have two things: We have the last page and script, which should be tied to the mentee, and we have the last mentee, which could be something we have saved to the user but in actuality, I think it should be something saved to the session rather than the db so that it will keep it on reload. This is very much secondary and I might just not even do it




Questions for Ariel:

- Pages 
 
Notes:



- Save body image when done as pdf (make that its own button as an option). If emailing is simple then do that but otherwise do like print to pdf with timestamp
