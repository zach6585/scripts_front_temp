Places where body image occurs:
- script 3 page 7
- script 4 page 9
- script 5 page 7
- script 6 pages 6, 8
- script 7 pages 8, 10
- script 9 pages 8, 10
- script 10 pages 8, 10
- script 12 pages 7, 9

Tasks for this:
    - Need to change all instances of "togglebodyimage" as we are no longer doing it over the actual page. It's purpose 
    - Need to make it so that it is a link rather than a popup on the page
    - Need to get rid of "handle body image clicked"
