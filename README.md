Whole project:

1) Script 1

2) Make changes as needed
    - Make sure everything that should be a textbox is one (Links, thing you wrote last week, etc.)
    - There are parts where she wants links to other pages (using redux)
    - Make most text boxes higher as scrolling will make things hard.
    - I've been really stupid and have only been looking at an iPad Pro!! I need to make sure it works for regular iPad too. Honestly I really should just be making multiple versions depending on size (Like I did with Freshlayers).
    - Solutions website
    - Body image page
    - Make sure all checks and xs are changed to their smaller counter parts
    

Extras: 
     
    - Save a value in db that's associated with the last page that user was on so that when they reload it goes back to that page, especially so they don't have to keep going back to page 1 now that this is a single page app.
        - The way to do this would have a "saved page" quality in the users table
    - Would have a "return to beginning" option on the last page

Notes:



- Save body image when done as pdf (make that its own button as an option). If emailing is simple then do that but otherwise do like print to pdf with timestamp
